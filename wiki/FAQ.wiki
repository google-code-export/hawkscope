= Windows =

=== I'm getting a "missing msvcr71.dll" warning when running the Windows executable ===
msvcr71.dll is Microsoft Visual C Runtime 7.1 Dynamic Link Library. This library is not distributed along with Hawkscope windows executable (below version 0.5.3). You can [http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71 download msvcr71.dll] and drop it to your C:\Windows\System32 folder, or simply update Hawkscope.

=== Where's the Windows 64-bit version? ===
32-bit version should run fine, so I did not install 64-bit Windows just to make a build. If you can provide a 64-bit Windows build, please do.

=== How did you make Windows .exe from a JAR file? And the Installer? ===
With [http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/ JSmooth] and [http://nsis.sourceforge.net NSIS].

=== How to add network shares to quick access list? ===
Since Hawkscope 0.4.0 you can do it via Settings -> Quick Access by adding a mounted share like a regular folder. Or you can map the network share to Windows drive (right click My Computer -> Map Network Drive), i.e.: S:. The drive will be automatically displayed in Hawkscope main menu.

= Linux =

=== Installation errors due to some dependency issues ===
Try enabling third party repositories. More [Installing here].

=== Can't load library: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386/xawt/libmawt.so ===
This means you had java-6-openjdk installed prior to sun-java6-jre. Run in Terminal:
{{{
sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun
}}}

=== I've made Hawkscope autostart in my Gnome sessions preference, but it does not show up ===
Please read the UsingHawkscope carefully. Due to Java Bug: [http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6438179 #6438179] you have to add `-delay 15000` (starts application 15 seconds later, so system tray loads first).

=== How to add network shares to quick access list? ===
Mount them first, then add in regular way (/mnt/share/name)

=== Hawkscope sucks, how to remove it? ===
{{{
sudo dpkg -r hawkscope
#to remove configuration
rm ~/.hawkscope.properties
}}}

= Mac OS X =

=== I would like to remove Hawkscope icon from the dock ===
I would like that too (Issue #31), however there is an Eclipse SWT bug on this subject: [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=268687 #268687]

= Plugins =

=== Twitter plugin does not work, and it also breaks Hawkscope menu from loading ===
Twitter API has [http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/f79c44d905a3e83d?pli=1 changed] recently. When [http://yusuke.homeip.net/twitter4j/en/index.html Twitter4J] library will adopt this change, new version of Twitter plugin will be out. Meanwhile please remove the plugin. Plugins are located at:
  * Mac: /Users/youruser/Library/Application Support/Hawkscope
  * Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\youruser\.hawkscope-plugins
  * Windows Vista: C:\Users\youruser\.hawkscope-plugins
  * Linux: /usr/share/hawkscope/plugins
Hawkscope 0.6.0 does not allow plugins to break the main menu.
Twitter plugin 1.4 has this issue fixed.
